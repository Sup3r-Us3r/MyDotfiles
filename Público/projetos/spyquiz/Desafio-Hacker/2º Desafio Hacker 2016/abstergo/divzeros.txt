x)   This is a parentheses for grouping expressions.
?x    Output the character x and returns x.
?     Input a character and return its ASCII number.
#x    Returns what the return value was of the x-1 iteration of the current
      subprogram. If x-1 is negative it returns the last return value of the 
      parent subprogram, if x is too large the subprogram quits.
#     Returns the number of the iteration of the current subprogram. First
      iteration is number zero.
<x    Returns left half unmingle of x.
>x    Returns right half unmingle of x.
_x    Returns x times negative one.
!x    Returns bitwise NOT x.
@     Returns parameter given to this function.
x*y
 x/y
  x%y Returns x times/divide/modulo y. If x is zero it will not evaluate y, and
      if y is zero in division or modulo function, the subprogram quits. The
      division is integer division rounded toward negative infinity.
x+y
 x-y  Returns x plus or minus y.
x&y   Returns bitwise x AND y. Does not evaluate y if x is zero.
x^y   Returns bitwise x XOR y.
x|y   Returns bitwise x OR y. Does not evaluate y if x is negative one.
x$y   Returns x mingle y (as in INTERCAL). If one of them is negative and one
      is non-negative, then y will be bitwise NOT before evaluation, to make
      both the same sign.
x~y   Returns x select y (as in INTERCAL). If x is zero it will not evaluate y.
[x]   Executes a subprogram in a loop. Returns the last return value of the
      subprogram expression before it quit.
