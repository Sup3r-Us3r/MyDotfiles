Hi, Jake
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry for that but I'll have to cancel our meeting today.
The server has been through  some instability, I don't know what's happening and they want me to fix it, 
so I guess I'll have to stay late.
<br>
They said there's a virus in /abstergo directory, but I don't know how to find it.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for understanding;
<br>
<br>
Edward
